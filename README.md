I struggle with the idea of sticking my head above the parapet. Recently, though I've struggled more with the idea of not trying to do something. Good stuff is fragile, it's easier to throw away than it is to gain.

This repo is for a set of writings/essays/articles, hopefully written collaboratively, which try to explain, in a thoughtful way, why certain ideas are worth pursuing. This is not about preaching to the choir because that doesn't convince anyone, and it's lazy and self-gratifying. Instead, this will try to defend the ideas to colleages, family members, and friends who may see things differently. It will assume everyone is well-intentioned and aims to make the world a better place, it's just the methods which differ.

The ideas are conservative in that the answers are generally not revolutionary, they're evolutionary. We want to preserve what's good and reduce what's bad. We have to be able to tell the difference, which is hard and involves the difficult interface between ideas and reality. Progress is small incremental improvements over time. Sometimes thinking may be trapped in local minima, in which case proposals will seem radical.

The aim is that this repo will ultimately drive the content on a web site somewhere. 

It would be great, if, in some tiny way, this could reduce the demand for populism and increase the demand for governments to make some progress with things in the 'hard tray'.

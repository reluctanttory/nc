The standard view of many on the left is that it's immoral to pay someone less than a "living wage", and that in-work benefits subsidise employers which pay low wages, so a high minimum wage is very attractive. 

There are many on the right who point out that a minimum wage is a ban on selling your labour if it's not worth the minimum wage. That a fair day's pay for a fair day's work is the market rate for that labour. That interfering with that market rate will have no effect for people whose labour is worth more, and job losses for people whose work is worth less.

The truth seems to be somewhere in the middle. TODO
